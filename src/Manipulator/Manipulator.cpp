	all of these open/closeSomething are all the same. 
	For teleop, put in joystick->GetRawButton()
	for auto, put in true
	the reason why I don't toggle (use one button to swtich between open/close) is that toggling doens't really work
	If in the future it does, I welcome you to do so. However, there are other problems.
	For one, the driver needs to know that the button will do one thing. If we toggle, he has to keep track of if said thing
	is open or not. this way, one button will open it no matter what and will close it no matter what. 
	It's just generally easier

	Finally, keep in mind that kForward â‰  open. OpenForklift is a perfect example as kReverse means to open
	This is why we have these functions, so you don't have to remember if one is reversed or not. 
	We found out which does what by experimentation

we ran out of space for solenoids so we had to use relays to activate the DoubleSolenoid
relays are pretty simple to understand so think of them as a switch. when a relay is activated, current flows and so the pison is activated
because each relay goes to activate the solenoid differently (one tells it to DoubleSolenoid::kForward, other DoubleSoleonid::kReverse)
one must be turned off
I'm fairly certain that the relays we used are Normally Open relays but you might want to check back with electronics about that. 
If relays still confuse you, talk to them.
