This file will explain the purpose of this branch:

The original code, the master branch, works well but is incredibly intuitive in its naming as well as its implementation of code. As such, this branch will try to correct this by ridding redundant and needless code while also renaming functions, variables, and classes as needed so that code is more readable. More importantly, some bit of comments will be added as I deem necessary.

PROGRESS:

	LimitSwitch Done
	OperatorInterface Done
	Manipulator Done
	Auto Seequence Not Done
